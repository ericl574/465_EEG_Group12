The closest analogue, Shannon\\'s differential entropy, \\nhas been shown to be incorrect from a mathematical perspective\\n(see, https://www.crmarsh.com/static/pdf/Charles_Marsh_Continuous_Entropy.pdf\\nand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_density_of_discrete_points )\\nI could not find an easy way to implement the LDDP here, nor any ready-to-use \\nfunction, so I\\'m leaving entropy out of the features for now.\\nA possible alternative would be to calculate the entropy of a histogram of each \\nsignal. Also something to discuss.\\n\\n2) CORRELATION\\nThe way the correlations were calculated in the previous script didn\\'t make \\nmuch sense. What was being done was calculating the correlations of 75 pairs of \\nvectors, each composed of a single observation of the 5 signals. I cannot think \\nof any reason why this would be interesting, or carry any useful information\\n(simply because the first sample of h1 should be no more related to the first \\nsample of h2 than it would be to the one immediately after - or before - it).\\nA (possibly) more useful information would be the correlations of each of the \\n5 signals against each other (maybe they can be correlated under some mental \\nstates and decorrelated for others)? This is already done by the covariance \\nmatrix.\\n\\n3) AUTOCORRELATION\\nA possibility would be to use the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of \\nthe signals. Both can be easily calculated, but would result in a massive \\namount of features (e.g., full autocorrelation would yield 2N-1 features per \\nsignal.). Not sure if we want that, but it\\'s something to consider.\\n\\n4) TSFRESH\\nPackage tsfresh seemingly has a load of features implemented for time series,\\nit may be worth exploring.\\n'"

    "Other notes by [fcampelo]:\n",
    "1) ENTROPY\n",
    "Entropy does not make sense for the \"continuous\" distribution of \n",
    "signal values. The closest analogue, Shannon's differential entropy, \n",
    "has been shown to be incorrect from a mathematical perspective\n",
    "(see, https://www.crmarsh.com/static/pdf/Charles_Marsh_Continuous_Entropy.pdf\n",
    "and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_density_of_discrete_points )\n",
    "I could not find an easy way to implement the LDDP here, nor any ready-to-use \n",
    "function, so I'm leaving entropy out of the features for now.\n",
    "A possible alternative would be to calculate the entropy of a histogram of each \n",
    "signal. Also something to discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) CORRELATION\n",
    "The way the correlations were calculated in the previous script didn't make \n",
    "much sense. What was being done was calculating the correlations of 75 pairs of \n",
    "vectors, each composed of a single observation of the 5 signals. I cannot think \n",
    "of any reason why this would be interesting, or carry any useful information\n",
    "(simply because the first sample of h1 should be no more related to the first \n",
    "sample of h2 than it would be to the one immediately after - or before - it).\n",
    "A (possibly) more useful information would be the correlations of each of the \n",
    "5 signals against each other (maybe they can be correlated under some mental \n",
    "states and decorrelated for others)? This is already done by the covariance \n",
    "matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) AUTOCORRELATION\n",
    "A possibility would be to use the autocorrelation and cross-correlation of \n",
    "the signals. Both can be easily calculated, but would result in a massive \n",
    "amount of features (e.g., full autocorrelation would yield 2N-1 features per \n",
    "signal.). Not sure if we want that, but it's something to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) TSFRESH\n",
    "Package tsfresh seemingly has a load of features implemented for time series,\n",
    "it may be worth exploring.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
